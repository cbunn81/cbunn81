# Christopher Bunn (cbunn81)

Hi, there! I'm a self-taught programmer and aspiring software engineer. I have experience with a variety of technologies with a focus on web development and automation. The tech stack I'm enjoying at the moment is Django (DRF) with PostgreSQL on the backend and React with Redux Toolkit on the frontend.

I'm based in Tokushima, Japan right now, but I'm originally from Philadelphia, PA, USA. I'm open to both remote work as well as onsite work in Japan or the US. Please have a look at some of my projects below and feel free to contact me.

## Projects

### [ECATS Test](https://github.com/globallabo/ecats-test)

This is a multiple-choice test app made to test the English level of Japanese EFL/ESL students. The backend is Django (DRF) with a PostgreSQL database. The frontend is React with Redux Toolkit, RTK-Query and Material UI. Deployment is via Docker.

### [Elite curriculum generation](https://github.com/globallabo/elite)

This is a project to easily generate a full set of PDFs for a business English curriculum with a standard template and content pulled from Google Sheets. The goal is to allow all team members to edit the content of lessons without any knowledge of the code which produces the end result. The content is stored as text in Google Sheets (along with some static images in the project directory). The templates are made with Jinja and custom HTML/CSS. And everything is brought together using a command-line app based in Python, with Typer as a framework and Weasyprint as a means to produce PDF output.
